Data was fetched from a hosted GitHub repository on a schedule managed by EventBridge and transformed using Python code running within a Lambda function. Transformed data was stored in a DynamoDB database and streamed to an S3 bucket. QuickSight was connected to the S3 bucket so COVID-19 data could be displayed on an easy to read dashboard. Code was tracked by Git version control and stored in a GitHub repository.",
